## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

As technology grows so does user demand for privacy. 
Using multiple and different passwords helps us to keep our data safe, However,
the difficulty of remembering the passwords keeps them unsecured on the device or alternatively on paper.

This is where we came in the picture with an android application that stores user's passwords and information securely on the device.

## Installation and Usage

Download and install Android Studio.
Open Android Studio.
Click on File ----> New -----> Project from Version Control ----> Git.
On the website of the repository click on "clone or download" and copy the link.
On Android Studio on the "Clone Repository" window paste the link in the URL and create a new directory.
Click on Clone.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
